<title>Emergency support to individuals and households affected by food insecurity in Chad</title>
<description>This project is a contribution to Caritas Switzerland’s emergency appeal for Chad (EA 15/2012).
 
Chad, like many of its neighbours in the Sahel region, is currently facing a food crisis. The 2011 rains were poor and unevenly distributed, which adversely affected 2011-2012 agricultural and pastoral production levels. According to reports, Chad is facing a 455,000 tonne grain deficit. 

This has led to a rise in the cost of basic food items; national market prices are currently 40-50% higher than the same period in 2011. The situation has been compounded by regional politics.  In Chad’s Sahel zone, economic migration into Libya is the norm. However, the recent crisis in Libya has restricted migration and affected local trade, leaving households increasingly vulnerable to price increases. 

Central areas of the country are already classified as ‘crisis’ (IPC Phase 3) and the lean season appears to have started two months earlier than normal.  Price increases are expected to continue into September, when the first crop harvests begin. There is therefore a need to provide vulnerable populations with basic food items during the lean period and improve their future resilience.  
 
EA 15/2012 was launched by Caritas Switzerland, in collaboration with Caritas Chad and ACORD. The overall objective of the program is to help reduce the effects of the food crisis on vulnerable populations in Sahelian and Sudanian areas.  At the operational level, the program is directed by UNAD, the Diocesan Caritas network in Chad and ACORD. Caritas Switzerland is responsible for monitoring, technical support and general coordination of the programme.

The project will be split into two as follows;

-  Emergency "Food security" projects implemented by UNAD and 8 Caritas Diocesan partners 
-  " Humanitarian risk management project"  implemented by ACORD. 
 
It will focus primarily on the provision of food, seeds, veterinary care and agricultural training, although there is a specific ACORD only element of early warning systems. 

CAFOD has decided to focus on Niger for its response to the West Africa Sahel food crisis. Nevertheless, as discussed in IEG on 21st June 2012, CAFOD also wants to express its solidarity to other Caritas agencies and affected populations in the region, and decided to make a solidarity grant towards the Chad EA 15/2012.

CAFOD’s contribution of £19,678 will be earmarked towards the UNAD project activities.
